  ## Description:
  This README file generator was created for future developers to use whenever they have to make a simple README for some project. You can input a title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions. You can also select from a list of 5 options for your license identification. In order to start the code, you need to install the inquirer package and for that you should have npm installed. If not then you can do it using the following commands that need to be written in your terminal. 
 ```
npm init
```
```
npm install
```

 
 The application will begin by typing the following command in the terminal and pressing the enter key:
 ```
node index.js
```
The user will be prompted to answer the input related questions. Once the user answers all the questions, a **README** file is generated.
